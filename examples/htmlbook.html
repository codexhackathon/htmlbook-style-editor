  <h1>Chapter Title</h1>
  <p>It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.</p>
<p>
      However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his
      first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds
      of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property
      of some one or other of their daughters.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that
      Netherfield Park is let at last?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told
      me all about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bennet made no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you not want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>You</i> want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was invitation enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by
      a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down
      on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted
      with it, that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take
      possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the
      house by the end of next week."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is his name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bingley."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is he married or single?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or
      five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How so? How can it affect them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You
      must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that his design in settling here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Design! Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he <i>may</i>
      fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as
      he comes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send
      them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are as
      handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the party."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, you flatter me. I certainly <i>have</i> had my share of beauty,
      but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has
      five grown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own
      beauty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into
      the neighbourhood."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is more than I engage for, I assure you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be
      for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely
      on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed
      you must go, for it will be impossible for <i>us</i> to visit him if you
      do not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad
      to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty
      consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must
      throw in a good word for my little Lizzy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the
      others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so
      good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving <i>her</i> the
      preference."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all
      silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of
      quickness than her sisters."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Bennet, how <i>can</i> you abuse your own children in such a way? You
      take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are
      my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these
      last twenty years at least."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, you do not know what I suffer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four
      thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not
      visit them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them
      all."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve,
      and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had been
      insufficient to make his wife understand his character. <i>Her</i> mind
      was less difficult to develop. She was a woman of mean understanding,
      little information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented, she
      fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her daughters
      married; its solace was visiting and news.

  <p>However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.</p>
